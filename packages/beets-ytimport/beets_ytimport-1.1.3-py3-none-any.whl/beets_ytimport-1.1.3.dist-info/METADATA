# beets-ytimport

A [Beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets) plugin to download audio from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) and import it into your library.

Differences compared to the [ydl plugin](https://github.com/vmassuchetto/beets-ydl):
* Supports downloading liked songs into your Beets library (using [ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi)).
* Stores m4a files instead of mp3 to avoid re-encoding lossy audio (which would decrease quality).
* Uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) instead of [ytdl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) to download the audio files.

## Installation

```sh
python3 -m pip install beets-ytimport ytmusicapi yt-dlp slugify
```

## Configuration

Enable the plugin and add a `ytimport` section to your Beets `config.yaml` as follows:
```yaml
plugins:
  - ytimport

ytimport:
  directory: /path/to/youtube/cache # required
  import: true
  likes: false
  max_likes: 15
  set: 'mykey=myvalue'
  auth_headers: /path/to/your/http/headers
  min_length: 60 # 1m; min track length in seconds
  max_length: 7200 # 2h; max track length in seconds
  max_length_nochapter: 600 # 10m; max track length when no chapters defined
  split_tracks: false
  group_albums: false
```

For more information, see [CLI](#cli).

## Usage

Once you enabled the `ytimport` plugin within your Beets configuration, you can download your liked songs from Youtube and import them into your Beets library as follows:
```sh
beet ytimport --likes --max-likes 3
```

Please note that the command prompts you for Google authentication, unless you specified the `auth_headers` option within your Beets configuration file pointing to a file containing HTTP headers (to get the HTTP headers, see [here](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/browser.html#copy-authentication-headers)).
Import auto-tagger prompts can be disabled by specifying the `-q` option.
You can interrupt and continue or repeat the command to synchronize likes from your Youtube account(s) into your Beets library incrementally.

To download a particular track, run:
```sh
beet ytimport --no-likes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC8CH0Z3L54
```

```sh
make beets-sh
```

For testing purposes the Beets library is written to `./data`.
