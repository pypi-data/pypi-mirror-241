Because on iOS, you only have to deal with one "byte."
```

```
$ eli add annotations to this file: $(cat file.py)

To add annotations to the given Python function, you can include comments and
docstrings to provide more information about the function's purpose and usage.
Here's an example:

    def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")

```
