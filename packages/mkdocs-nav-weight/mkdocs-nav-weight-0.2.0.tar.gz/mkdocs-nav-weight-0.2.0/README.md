# mkdocs-nav-weight

**A simple mkdocs plugin, enables to organize Navigation in a more markdownic way.** 

> **This plugin tries to read markdown resources before mkdocs, which may add some performance overhead on building.**

## Usage

Four additional keys can be configured in Markdown Metadata ( also known as "front-matter", see [metadata](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#meta-data)).

- `weight: number`
    - **Value: number, eg: `-1`, `2.3` ..., if unset, it goes `0`**.
    - like weight in Hugo but has some differences, used for ordering your sections/pages. Lower weight gets higher precedence. So content with lower weight will come first. 
    - **`weight` in an `index` will be offered to its parent `section`**, there is a fixed value for itself, and the value is configurable, see: [`index_weight`](#index_weight).

- `headless: bool`
    - **Value: bool, `true` or `false`, if unset, it goes `false`**.
    - like headless in Hugo, pages/sections with `headless: true` will be hidden from nav, but these contents will still be rendered and accessible via URL.
    - **`headless` in an `index` will be offered to its parent `section`**.

**For `index` only:**

- `retitled: bool`
    - **Value: bool, `true` or `false`, if unset, it goes `false`**.
    - A metadata version of [`section_renamed`](#section_renamed) which only applies this `index`'s title to its parent `section`, **it only works when `section_renamed` is `false`**.

- `empty: bool`
    - **Value: bool, `true` or `false`, if unset, it goes `false`**.
    - If there is an `index` only used to offer metadata for its parent `section` and without any meaningful content, setting `empty` to `true` can help you to hide this `index` itself.

## Installation

Install with `pip`:


```shell
pip install mkdocs-nav-weight
```

Add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocs-nav-weight
```

## Options

Configure in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocs-nav-weight:
      section_renamed: false
      index_weight: -10
      warning: true
      reverse: false
      headless_included: false
```

#### `section_renamed`

Default: `false`:

- If `true`, section name will use the `title` of its `index` instead of the folder name. 

- For compatibility we have to name a folder like "C#" as "CSharp", but what we actually want is "C#" , that's what this option does

#### `index_weight`

Default: `-10`:

- The `weight` value for `index` itself, to ensure it's always the first at the same level

#### `warning`

Default: `true`:

- Controls whether to send a `Warning` when invalid values are detected in markdown metadata

#### `reverse`

Default: `false`:

- If `true`, sort nav by `weight` from largest to smallest.

#### `headless_included`

Default: `false`:

- An option to control whether `headless` pages should be included in `nav.pages` which is used by some plugins, eg: [mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin](https://github.com/zhaoterryy/mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin).

- If `true`, `headless` pages will be included.
