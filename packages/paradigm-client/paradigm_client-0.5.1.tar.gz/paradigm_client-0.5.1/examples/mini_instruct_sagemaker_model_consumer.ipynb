    "# Using `Mini-instruct` on SageMaker through Model Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by <a href=\"https://lighton.ai/\"/>LightOn</a>, `mini-instruct` is a powerful, multilingual AI model with 40B parameters trained on high-quality data from a variety of sources. It is built using Falcon LLM technology from the Technology Innovation Institute.\n",
    "It is designed to understand natural language and respond to instructions tailored to your needs. It works great in consumer products, such as chatbots, voice assistants, and smart appliances. It also has broad applications in the enterprise, such as natural language generation for automated customer service or agent assist for customer support.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know more about the best ways to prompt large language models, you can have a look at the <a href=\"https://lightonai.github.io/paradigm-docs/guides/prompt\">documentation</a>. If you are familiar with the prompting literature, advanced techniques like <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\">Chain of Thought</a> also work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing is as easy as adding *Summary :* after the relevant text snippet, simply change it to *Keywords :* to perform keywords extraction instead. The only limit is what you can express in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "\n",
    ">Extract the key words from the following article: Corium is a metallic and mineral magma consisting of the molten elements of a nuclear reactor core, and then the minerals it may absorb as it travels. The term \"corium\" is a neologism formed from core, followed by the suffix -ium, which is present in the names of many elements in the periodic table of elements: lithium, calcium, uranium, plutonium, helium, strontium, etc. Initially made up of the nuclear fuel (mainly enriched uranium oxide), the elements of the fuel assembly and the various pieces of core equipment (control rods, instrumentation) or the wall of the reactor vessel with which it comes into contact, it forms at very high temperature (around 3,000Â°C, the melting temperature of uranium oxide) when the core is no longer cooled, as during nuclear accidents such as those at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl or Fukushima.\n",

    "User: Ok, now for a science question. What can you tell me about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)? \n",
    "Mini: Itâs a large and very expensive piece of science equipment. If I understand correctly, itâs a high-energy particle collider, built by CERN, and completed in 2008. They used it to confirm the existence of the Higgs boson in 2012. \n",

Let's take this big caterpillar. If the insect is really threatened, for example by a bird, it defends itself with formic acid. It has a small gland under its mouth and sprays acid in the direction of the attack. If the bird grabs the caterpillar in its beak, here the insect turns around and shoots a stream of acid.\"\n",

So there's a good chance that this volcano will erupt explosively. The danger is real. Most people are not aware of it. It is as important to raise awareness as it is to monitor the volcano.
