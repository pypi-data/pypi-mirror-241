    computes k-shortest paths with a maximum overlap of `sim_threshold`.

    Parameters
    ----------

    costs: numpy.ndarray
        float, 1D - cost for each link
    out_links: dyntapy.csr.UI32CSRMatrix
        adjacency structure
    source: int
        source node
    target: int
        target node
    k: int
        number of paths to generate
    is_centroid: np.ndarray
        bool, 1D - centroids are ignored for routing
    sim_threshold: float
        threshold for similarity between paths in the solution set, [0,1]
    detour_rejection: float
        path quality criteria

    Returns
    -------

    solution_paths: list of list
        each entry is a solution path
    path_lengths : list
        length of each solution path as the sum of traversed link costs

    Notes
    -----

    `detour_rejection` has been added by the developers to prune bad solutions.
    A value of 0.10 indicates that paths can be at most 10 percent worse than the
    shortest path solution. Similar to a lower `sim_threshold` this setting may
    affect the completeness of the results, see [5]_.
