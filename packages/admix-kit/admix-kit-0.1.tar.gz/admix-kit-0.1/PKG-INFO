`admix-kit` is a Python library to facilitate analyses and methods development of genetics data from admixed populations.

> `admix-kit` is currently in beta version and frequently updating. We welcome any [feature requests or bug reports](https://github.com/KangchengHou/admix-kit/issues). Please ask us **"Can `admix-kit` do XX?"**. There is chance that some function has already been implemented but not well documented. We can prioritize more useful work if you let us know.


## Installation
```bash
# Install admix-kit with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
git clone https://github.com/KangchengHou/admix-kit
cd admix-kit && pip install -e .
```
> Installation requires cmake version > 3.12. Use `cmake --version` to check your cmake version. Use `pip install cmake` to install the latest version.

> In some cases, `admix` may not be automatically to your `$PATH` (e.g., because of user installation mode). You need to look through the log and find where `admix` script is installed to and manually add that to your `$PATH` (e.g., type `PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin`). 

> To specify a version of admix-kit, use `git clone https://github.com/KangchengHou/admix-kit --branch v0.1`, or replace `v0.1` to other versions listed in https://github.com/KangchengHou/admix-kit/releases.
