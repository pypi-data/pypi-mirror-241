# LongNet Implementation Research Document

## System Analysis

The LongNet architecture is based on the Transformers but with a twist to handle longer sequences. Its foundation is on the self-attention mechanism that maps a query and a set of keys and values to output. However, self-attention struggles with longer sequences due to its quadratic dependency on sequence length, which leads to computational inefficiencies.

To resolve this, LongNet introduces the Dilated Attention method that splits the input into equally sized segments. Each segment is then sparsified along the sequence dimension by selecting the rows with a certain interval. The computation can be written as per the provided equations.

Dilated attention reduces the computation cost significantly over vanilla attention. In practice, the segment size trades the globality of attention for efficiency, while the dilation with a certain size reduces the computation cost by approximating the attention matrix.

To capture both long-range and short-range information efficiently, a mixture of dilated attentions with different segment sizes and dilation rates is implemented.

LongNet also incorporates the multi-head attention mechanism, with each head having a distinct offset when selecting the query-key-value pairs.

## Algorithmic Pseudocode

The following is a high-level pseudocode for the LongNet model:

```python
class LongNet:
    Initialize parameters for LongNet

    def dilated_attention(self, input):
        # Split the input into segments
        input_segments = split(input)
        
        # Sparsify each segment along the sequence dimension
        sparsified_segments = sparsify(input_segments)
        
        # Feed sparsified segments into attention
        attended_segments = attention(sparsified_segments)
        
        # Scatter and concatenate the segments as output
        output = scatter_and_concatenate(attended_segments)
        
        return output

    def multi_head_dilated_attention(self, input):
        # For each head
        for head in heads:
            # Offset the query-key-value pairs
            offset_qkv = offset(head)
            
            # Perform dilated attention
            output = self.dilated_attention(offset_qkv)
        
        # Concatenate the outputs of different heads
        final_output = concatenate(output)
        
        return final_output

    def forward(self, input):
        output = self.multi_head_dilated_attention(input)
        return output
```

## Actual Code

Now, let's implement the LongNet model using PyTorch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.nn import MultiheadAttention

class DilatedAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, heads, dilation_rate, segment_size):
        super(DilatedAttention, self).__init__()
        self.dim = dim
        self.heads = heads
        self.dilation_rate = dilation_rate
        self.segment_size = segment_size
        self.attention = MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=dim, heads=heads)

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size, seq_len, _ = x.shape

        # Split and sparsify
        x = x.view(batch_size, -1, self.segment_size, self.dim)
        x = x[:, :, ::self.dilation_rate, :]

        # Perform attention
        attn_output, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)

        # Scatter and concatenate
        attn_output = attn_output.view(batch_size, -1, self.dim)
        return attn_output

```



# Multi-Modal Dilation Attention
Creating a multi-modal version of DilatedAttention involves extending the attention mechanism to handle input from multiple modalities (e.g., text, audio, video) simultaneously. This involves processing each modality with its own dedicated attention mechanism and then combining the results in a meaningful way.

Here's an architectural overview, requirements, simplifications, optimizations, pseudocode, and implementation for this:

## Architectural Overview
In a multi-modal DilatedAttention, we first apply individual DilatedAttention modules to each modality. The outputs of these modules are then concatenated along the feature dimension, resulting in a tensor that includes attention features from all modalities. Finally, another DilatedAttention module is applied to the concatenated features, allowing cross-modality interactions to be captured.

## Requirements
1. Individual attention mechanisms for each modality that understand the modality-specific data.
2. Mechanism to concatenate the modality-specific attention outputs.
3. Final attention mechanism that captures the cross-modality interactions.
4. Variable modality support, as not all modalities might be available for every data point.

## Simplifications
1. All modalities are treated independently until the final concatenation and cross-modality attention step.
2. Modality-specific attention mechanisms are assumed to be capable of handling their respective data types.
3. The architecture is flexible with the number and types of modalities. It can work even if one or more modalities are missing.

## Optimizations
1. Parallel Processing: Since the modality-specific attention computations are independent, they can be performed in parallel, leading to significant speedup.
2. Dynamic Computation: If a modality is not available for a certain data point, its computation can be skipped.
3. Attention Reduction: If the cross-modality attention proves too expensive, you could reduce the number of attention heads or lower the dimensionality of the attention space.

## Pseudocode

```pseudocode
function MULTIMODAL_DILATED_ATTENTION(input_modality_data):
    for each modality in input_modality_data:
        apply DILATED_ATTENTION to modality data
    concatenate all modality attention outputs
    apply CROSS_MODALITY_ATTENTION to concatenated outputs
    return cross_modality_attention_outputs
end function
```

## Python Implementation with PyTorch
I will use the MultiwayNetwork that you've shared as a starting point, which serves as a wrapper that can process different splits of data separately.

```python
class MultiModalDilatedAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout=0.0, causal=False, num_modalities=2):
        super(MultiModalDilatedAttention, self).__init__()

        self.dim = dim
        self.num_modalities = num_modalities
        self.dilated_attns = nn.ModuleList(
            [DilatedAttention(dim, heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout, causal) for _ in range(num_modalities)]
        )
        self.cross_modality_attn = DilatedAttention(num_modalities * dim, heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout, causal)

    def forward(self, x):
        modality_outputs = []
        for modality_data, attn in zip(x, self.dilated_attns):
            modality_outputs.append(attn(modality_data))

        cross_modality_input = torch.cat(modality_outputs, dim=-1)
        cross_modality_output = self.cross_modality_attn(cross_modality_input)

        return cross_modality_output
```
In this Python implementation, `x` is expected to be a list of tensors, each corresponding to a different modality. The `DilatedAttention` mechanism is applied to each modality independently, and the results are then concatenated and passed through a final `DilatedAttention` mechanism to capture cross-modality interactions.

Please note that this is a fairly straightforward extension of DilatedAttention to multiple modalities and might require further enhancements to optimally deal with multi-modal data. For instance, attention normalization or scaling might be needed when concatenating modality-specific attention outputs. The choice of the final cross-modality attention mechanism could also be modified as per the needs of your specific application.


# Implementing SOTA methods

Implementing Relative Position Bias and Rotary Position Embedding (XPOS) into the Dilated Attention module can add positional information to the model, enhancing the attention mechanism's ability to understand sequential dependencies.

1. **Relative Position Bias**: This approach computes relative distances between the positions in the sequence and uses these distances to modify the attention scores. This allows the model to understand and utilize the relative position of tokens in the sequence, which is particularly important in many language tasks.

2. **Rotary Position Embedding (XPOS)**: This approach is a variant of sinusoidal position embedding that applies a continuous rotation to each tokenâ€™s embedding. This can be more efficient and flexible compared to standard position embeddings, as it does not require storing separate embeddings for each position.

Both of these additions provide information about the order of tokens in a sequence, which can be crucial for many tasks.

However, they add to the complexity of the model, which may have implications for computational cost and memory usage. Also, they may introduce challenges in training, as the model must learn to effectively integrate this positional information.

**Implementation**:

Let's integrate the `RelativePositionBias` and `XPOS` into the `DilatedAttention` class. 

```python
class DilatedAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout=0.0, casual=False):
        super(DilatedAttention, self).__init__()
        self.dim = dim
        self.heads = heads

        self.dilation_rate = dilation_rate
        self.segment_size = segment_size

        self.attention = FlashMHA(embed_dim=dim, heads=heads, device=device, dtype=dtype)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.casual = casual

        self.relative_bias = RelativePositionBias(num_buckets=32, max_distance=128, n_heads=heads)
        self.xpos = XPOS(head_dim=dim//heads)

    def get_mask(self, i, j):
        return torch.ones((i, j), device=device, dtype=torch.bool).triu(j - i + 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size, seq_len, _ = x.shape

        # Apply XPOS
        x = self.xpos(x)
        
        # Split and sparsify
        x = x.view(batch_size, -1, self.segment_size, self.dim)
        x = x[:, :, :: self.dilation_rate, :]

        # Perform attention
        attn_output, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)

        # Apply relative position bias
        attn_output += self.relative_bias(batch_size, attn_output.size(1), attn_output.size(1))

        # if casual create a mask and apply to the output
        if self.casual:
            mask = self.get_mask(attn_output.size(1), attn_output.size(1))
            attn_output = attn_output.masked_fill(mask, float('-inf'))

        # apply dropout
        attn_output = self.dropout(attn_output)

        # Scatter and concatenate 
        attn_output = attn_output.view(batch_size, -1, self.dim)
        return attn_output
```

**New Documentation**:

`DilatedAttention` now includes `RelativePositionBias` and `XPOS` for incorporating positional information. 

`RelativePositionBias` adds a bias to the attention scores based on the relative distances between sequence positions. This mechanism is controlled by the `num_buckets`, `max_distance`, and `n_heads` parameters.

`XPOS` applies rotary position embeddings to the input sequence, giving positional context to the model.

Both features can be helpful in tasks where sequence order matters. They are automatically applied in the forward method, but keep in mind that these add to the model complexity.

Use this model just like the previous version. The input to the forward method is a tensor with shape `(batch_size, seq_len, dim)`, where `seq_len` is the sequence length and `dim` is the model dimension. It returns an output tensor with the same shape. The model takes care of applying the `RelativePositionBias` and `XPOS` transformations automatically.


Taking into account the multi-head attention specifics and computational complexity from the paper, the `DilatedAttention` class can be updated as follows. Now we include an offset for each attention head when selecting the query, key, and value vectors. And the outputs of different heads are concatenated into a final output as described in the paper.

The attention computation complexity estimation formulas from the paper are a great way to theoretically assess the efficiency of the algorithm, but they're not directly incorporated into the code since they don't affect the actual functionality of the algorithm. However, they can be used as a reference when testing and optimizing the algorithm.

Please note, handling the details of distributed training (e.g. splitting input sequences across GPUs, collecting key-value pairs across devices etc.) as described in Section 3 of the paper would need to be implemented outside of this class, typically at a higher level in the model's training loop.

```python
import torch 
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

from torchscale import XPOS, RelativePositionBias

device = "cuda:0"  # Replace this with your correct GPU device
dtype=torch.float16

class DilatedAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout=0.0, casual=False, use_xpos=False, use_rel_pos_bias=False):
        super(DilatedAttention, self).__init__()
        self.dim = dim
        self.heads = heads

        self.dilation_rate = dilation_rate
        self.segment_size = segment_size

        self.attentions = nn.ModuleList([FlashMHA(embed_dim=dim, heads=heads, device=device, dtype=dtype) for _ in range(self.dilation_rate)])
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.casual = casual

        self.use_xpos = use_xpos
        self.use_rel_pos_bias = use_rel_pos_bias

        if use_xpos:
            self.xpos = XPOS(head_dim=dim//heads)
        if use_rel_pos_bias:
            self.relative_bias = RelativePositionBias(num_buckets=32, max_distance=128, n_heads=heads)

    def get_mask(self, i, j):
        return torch.ones((i, j), device=device, dtype=torch.bool).triu(j - i + 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size, seq_len, _ = x.shape

        if self.use_xpos:
            x = self.xpos(x)

        # Collect outputs from each attention head
        all_head_outputs = []
        for head_idx, attention in enumerate(self.attentions):
            offset = head_idx % self.dilation_rate

            x_ = x[:, offset::self.dilation_rate, :]  # Apply offset for each head
            x_ = x_.contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.segment_size, self.dim)

            attn_output, _ = attention(x_, x_, x_)
            if self.use_rel_pos_bias:
                attn_output += self.relative_bias(batch_size, attn_output.size(1), attn_output.size(1))

            if self.casual:
                mask = self.get_mask(attn_output.size(1), attn_output.size(1))
                attn_output = attn_output.masked_fill(mask, float('-inf'))

            attn_output = self.dropout(attn_output)

            # Resize back to original size
            attn_output_resized = torch.zeros((batch_size, seq_len, self.dim), device=device, dtype=dtype)
            attn_output_resized[:, offset::self.dilation_rate, :] = attn_output.contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.dim)
            
            all_head_outputs.append(attn_output_resized)

        # Concatenate the outputs of different heads
        outputs_concatenated = torch.cat(all_head_outputs, dim=-1)

        return outputs_concatenated
```

The offsets are now properly handled, creating a different "view" of the input for each attention head. Also, the outputs from each head are concatenated together instead of being summed, which is more in line with the traditional multi-head attention mechanism. 

However, there are a few important caveats to keep in mind:
1. The current implementation assumes the number of attention heads equals the dilation rate. If this is not the case, you will have to adjust the implementation accordingly.
2. It also assumes that the input sequence length is divisible by the dilation rate, which might not always be the case in practice. In real situations, you would probably need to handle this by properly padding or truncating the input sequence.
3. Depending on the specific context, applying dropout to the output of each head individually might not be the best approach. It could be beneficial to apply dropout after concatenating the outputs together.
4. I've retained the position encoding and relative position bias options, although the paper doesn't seem to mention them. If you're trying to replicate the paper's results exactly, you might want to disable them.

Here's the updated code for a distributed version of the `DilatedAttention` class. I want to emphasize that the distributed training aspect should be handled in your training loop or pipeline, as it involves the overall data and model distribution strategy that is beyond the scope of this single attention module. The provided code is just a simple demonstration of how to collect the key-value pairs from different GPUs before computing the attention:

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

from torchscale import XPOS, RelativePositionBias

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

class DistributedDilatedAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout=0.0, casual=False, use_xpos=False, use_rel_pos_bias=False):
        super(DistributedDilatedAttention, self).__init__()
        self.dim = dim
        self.heads = heads

        self.dilation_rate = dilation_rate
        self.segment_size = segment_size

        self.attentions = nn.ModuleList([FlashMHA(embed_dim=dim, heads=heads, device=device) for _ in range(self.dilation_rate)])
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.casual = casual

        self.use_xpos = use_xpos
        self.use_rel_pos_bias = use_rel_pos_bias

        if use_xpos:
            self.xpos = XPOS(head_dim=dim//heads)
        if use_rel_pos_bias:
            self.relative_bias = RelativePositionBias(num_buckets=32, max_distance=128, n_heads=heads)

    def get_mask(self, i, j):
        return torch.ones((i, j), device=device, dtype=torch.bool).triu(j - i + 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size, seq_len, _ = x.shape

        if self.use_xpos:
            x = self.xpos(x)

        # Collect outputs from each attention head
        all_head_outputs = []
        for head_idx, attention in enumerate(self.attentions):
            offset = head_idx % self.dilation_rate

            x_ = x[:, offset::self.dilation_rate, :]  # Apply offset for each head
            x_ = x_.contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.segment_size, self.dim)

            # compute attention locally, gather the key-value pairs before computing the attention
            attn_output, _ = attention(x_, x_, x_)
            dist.all_gather(attn_output, attn_output)

            if self.use_rel_pos_bias:
                attn_output += self.relative_bias(batch_size, attn_output.size(1), attn_output.size(1))

            if self.casual:
                mask = self.get_mask(attn_output.size(1), attn_output.size(1))
                attn_output = attn_output.masked_fill(mask, float('-inf'))

            attn_output = self.dropout(attn_output)

            # Resize back to original size
            attn_output_resized = torch.zeros((batch_size, seq_len, self.dim), device=device)
            attn_output_resized[:, offset::self.dilation_rate, :] = attn_output.contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.dim)
            
            all_head_outputs.append(attn_output_resized)

        # Concatenate the outputs of different heads
        outputs_concatenated = torch.cat(all_head_outputs, dim=-1)

        return outputs_concatenated
```
This code is a simple attempt to implement the distributed strategy described in the paper, and it's far from a complete solution. In a real-world setting, you would likely need to handle many additional complexities. For instance:

- Checking the availability of multiple GPUs and appropriately distributing the computation among them.
- Efficiently handling GPU memory, to prevent out-of-memory errors when the sequence length is large.
- Dealing with potential communication overhead when collecting the key-value pairs from different GPUs.
- Handling edge cases where the sequence length is not perfectly divisible by the number of GPUs or the dilation rate.
- Integrating with a larger model architecture and training loop, including handling the backward pass and parameter updates.
- Tuning the performance to fully take advantage of the potential speed-up offered by distributed computing.

Furthermore, the current implementation assumes the use of PyTorch's built-in distributed package. Depending on your specific requirements and computing environment, you might want to use a different package or even write your own custom distributed computing logic.

Therefore, I'd highly recommend carefully studying PyTorch's [official documentation on distributed computing](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) and seeking expert advice before attempting to scale this to a production-level implementation.



The provided code implements the Dilated Attention mechanism with multiple heads and different dilation rates. However, it seems to be missing some key components mentioned in the paper:

Mixture of Dilated Attentions: The paper suggests implementing a mixture of dilated attentions with different segment sizes and dilation rates. This is not implemented in the provided code. The weights for the mixture are calculated dynamically based on the denominator of the attention softmax, which is also not present in the code.

Geometric Sequences for Segment Sizes and Dilation Rates: The paper suggests setting the segment sizes and dilation rates to geometric sequences for an exponential attentive field. This is not reflected in the provided code.

Distributed Training Algorithm: The paper describes a distributed training algorithm that allows the model to scale up to 1 billion tokens. This is a significant feature that is not implemented in the provided code.

Here's how we could implement these missing pieces:

Mixture of Dilated Attentions: We could modify the forward method to compute the output for each combination of segment size and dilation rate, and then combine these outputs using the dynamic weights. The dynamic weights could be computed by adding a softmax layer that takes the denominator of the attention softmax as input.

Geometric Sequences for Segment Sizes and Dilation Rates: We could modify the __init__ method to generate geometric sequences for the segment sizes and dilation rates. This could be done using the torch.logspace function.

Distributed Training Algorithm: Implementing this feature would require significant changes to the code. We would need to split the input sequence across multiple devices, compute the attention on each device, and then gather the results. This could be done using PyTorch's distributed computing features, such as torch.nn.DataParallel or torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.

Please note that implementing these features would require a deep understanding of the Dilated Attention mechanism and the specific requirements of your application. It would also likely require extensive testing and debugging to ensure that the implementation is correct and efficient.
