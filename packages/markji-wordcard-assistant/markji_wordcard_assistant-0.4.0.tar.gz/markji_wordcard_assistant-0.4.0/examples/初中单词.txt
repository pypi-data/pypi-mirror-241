###Films
What films do you like?#I enjoy comedies the most as they uplift my mood. I often go to watch comedy films with my friends and parents, and we have a great time together.
Did you often watch films when you were a child?#Not really. When I was young, I didn't have much interest in films and often found it hard to understand many of them.
Did you ever go to the cinema alone as a child?#Once, my mother bought movie tickets, but she got too busy, so I went to the cinema alone. I felt it was a negative experience as I couldnâ€™t share the exciting movie content with my mother. So, I never went to the cinema alone again.
Do you often go to the cinema with your friends?#Yes, after watching films together, we can discuss the movie, which is a good way to find common interests.
Do you think going to the cinema is a good way to spend time with friends?#Yes, if my friends and I are feeling bored, watching a movie together is a good way to kill time.
