# This tutorial will guide you on how to use pytest for testing chatbot responses.
# pytest is a testing framework that allows you to easily create small, simple tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing.
# We will use the deepeval library which provides tools for evaluating language models.
# The library includes test cases, metrics, and a function to assert the test results.


# First, we will define a simple test case. The test case includes a query, expected output, and context.
# The query is the question asked to the chatbot, the output is the expected answer, and the context is the actual answer.
# We then use the assert_test function from deepeval to check if the chatbot's response is as expected.

    input = "What are your operating hours?"
    output = "Our operating hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday."
    context = ["Our company operates from 10 AM to 6 PM, Monday to Friday."]
    factual_consistency_metric = FactualConsistencyMetric(minimum_score=0.3)
    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(minimum_score=0.5)
    test_case = LLMTestCase(input=input, actual_output=output, context=context)
    assert_test(
        test_case, [factual_consistency_metric, answer_relevancy_metric]
    )


# We can also define multiple test cases at once in a list of dictionaries.
# Each dictionary represents a test case and can be directly used in our tests.
# The keys of the dictionary are the column names in the DataFrame (query, output, context).
# The values are the corresponding values for each test case.
