# Azure Data Factory v2 - Unit Testing Framework

## Development

### Prerequisites

* poetry == 1.6.1

### Run Linting

We use Ruff to lint our code as it provides similar rule sets to well-established linters into one (e.g., black, flake8, isort, and pydocstyle).

To run linting, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run ruff .
```
