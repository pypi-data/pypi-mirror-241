Overview
--------

The howe project contains the Howe class. An Howe object is similar to a zip object, except that all the iterators have to run out at the same time. Otherwise an ExceptionGroup (containing the StopIteration exceptions from the iterators that did run out) will be raised. The project is named for E. Howe, one of the intentors of the zipper.

Installation
------------

To install howe, you can use `pip`. Open your terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install howe
