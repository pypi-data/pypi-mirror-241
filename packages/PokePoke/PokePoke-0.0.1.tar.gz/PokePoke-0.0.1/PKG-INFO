# PokePoke

The PokeAPI is a RESTful API that serves as a comprehensive database for PokÃ©mon-related data. It offers a wide range of information about PokÃ©mon species, their abilities, moves, types, evolutions, and more. By providing endpoints for various queries, such as retrieving details about specific PokÃ©mon or abilities, the PokeAPI allows developers to access and utilize PokÃ©mon-related data in their applications. It serves as a valuable resource for enthusiasts, developers, and researchers interested in integrating PokÃ©mon-related information into their projects.
