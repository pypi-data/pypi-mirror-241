         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        
          This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
        the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
        License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
        
          0. Additional Definitions.
        
          As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
        General Public License.
        
          "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
        other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        
          An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
        
          A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
        Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
        Version".
        
          The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
        
          The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
        
          1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
          2. Conveying Modified Versions.
        
          If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
        version:
        
           a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
           function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        
           b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
           this License applicable to that copy.
        
          3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
        
          The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
        a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
           Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
          4. Combined Works.
        
          You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
        taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
        portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
        engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
        the following:
        
           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
           the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.
        
           b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
           document.
        
           c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
           execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
           these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
           copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
        
           d) Do one of the following:
        
               0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
               suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
               recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
               the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
               manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
               Corresponding Source.
        
               1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
               Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
               a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
               system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
               of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
               Version.
        
           e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
           be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
           GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
           necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
           Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
           Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
           you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
           the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
           Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
           Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
           for conveying Corresponding Source.)
        
          5. Combined Libraries.
        
          You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
        Library side by side in a single library together with other library
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
        choice, if you do both of the following:
        
           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
           on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
           conveyed under the terms of this License.
        
           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
           is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
           accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        
          6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
        Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
        applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
        conditions either of that published version or of any later version
        published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
        received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
        General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
        Library.

# 包 Late
Late binding for Python default arguments


## What is it?

**包 Late** provides decorators and functions to work around the issues that early binding of
default argument values produces in Python.

What follows is not intuitive for newcomers to Python, but it's something that everyone learns quickly:

```python
>>> def f(x=[]):
...     x.append(1)
...     return x
...
>>> f()
[1]
>>> f()
[1, 1]
>>> f()
[1, 1, 1]
```

The behavior in Python is that the same initializer value is passed on every function
invocation, so using mutable values produces the above results.

The coding pattern to work around the above is to use ``None`` as the initializer, and check for
the argument value at the start of the function code:

```python
>>> def f(x=None):
...     if x is None:
...         x = []
...     x.append(1)
...     return x
...
>>> f()
[1]
>>> f()
[1]
>>> f()
[1]
```

It's ugly, but it works.

Now comes the other ugly part.  When using type annotations, the above function must be declared 
in a way so that type checkers do not complain about using ``None`` as the default value:

```python
def f(x: list[Any] | None = None) -> list[Any]:
```

Another problem with the above declaration is that calling ``f(None)`` passes type checking, 
when that's probably not the preferred situation.


## A solution

**包 Late** provides a way to solve the above ugliness with some decorator magic. This is how the code 
looks with some of that magic:

```python
from late import latebinding, __


@latebinding
def f(x: list[Any] = __([])) -> list[Any]:
    x.append(1)
    return x

assert f() == [1]
assert f() == [1]
assert f() == [1]

```


### Working with classes

**包 Late** also works with classes and `dataclass`. The ``@latebinding`` decorator 
must be the outer one:

```python
@latebinding
@dataclass
class C:
    x: list[Any] = __([])  # noqa

c = C()
assert c.x == []

d = C()
assert d.x == []
c.x = [1]
assert c.x == [1]
assert d.x == []

assert d.x is not c.x

```


### Working with iterators

**包 Late** allows passing an iterator as a default argument value, 
and it will provide the next value on each function call. The usefulness of
this feature is unknown, but it's something that came up during the discussions
about default arguments, so **包 Late** implements it.


```python
    def fib() -> Iterator[int]:
        x, y = 0, 1
        while True:
            yield x
            x, y = y, x + y


    @latebinding
    def f(x: int = __(fib())) -> int:
        return x

    assert f() == 0
    assert f() == 1
    assert f() == 1
    assert f() == 2
    assert f() == 3
    assert f() == 5
```

This is a possible use for the iterator feature. Imagine a function that requires a unique ID, and 
will generate one if none is provided. Without **包 Late** the declaration would be:

```python
def get_session(uniqueid: int | None = None) -> Session:
    if uniqueid is None:
        uniqueid = make_unique_id()
```

Using **包 Late**, the declaration can be:

```python
def unique_id_generator() -> Iterator[int]:
    while True:
        yield make_unique_id()

@latebinding
def get_session(uniqueid: int = __(unique_id_generator())) -> Session:
```


### Working with functions

**包 Late** also allows late-binding for functions, so the above example could be implemented using 
a function instead of a generator:

```python
@latebinding
def get_session(uniqueid: int = __(make_unique_id)) -> Session:
```

The given function will be called once every time the ``uniqueid`` argument is omitted.

### About name choice

The names of what **包 Late** exports are chosen to be explicit where it matters, and to not get in
the way of the visuals of a declaration. In particular, ``__()`` was chosen to interfere the least 
possible with reading a function declaration (``late()`` is another name for it, and ``__`` is 
seldom used in Python code).

At any rate, **包 Late** is so simple and so small that you can apply any changes you like and use it as another part of your code instead of installing it as a library.


### How does it work?

For values of immutable types, ``__()`` will return the same value. For all other types ``__()`` 
will wrap the value in a special ``namedtuple(actual=value)``. At function invocation time, this it what happens:

* if the argument name is already in ``kwargs``, nothing is done
* if the wrapped value is an iterator, then ``next(actual)`` is used
* if the wrapped value is a function, then ``actual()`` is used
* in all other cases ``copy.deepcopy(actual)`` is used

For convenient type checking, ``__()`` is declared so its type will be the desired one depending
on the argument:

```python
def late(o: _T | Iterator[_V] | Callable[[], _R]) -> _T | _V | _R:
```

### Why doesn't the Python interpreter solve this?

Although the ugliness and inconvenience in the current situation have ben acknowledged 
and discussed for a very long time, there has never been an agreement about the usefulness,
the semantics, nor the syntax for a solution. That way the _status quo_ has remained unchanged.

You can find a recent discussion about these topics on the 
[Python Ideas](https://discuss.python.org/t/revisit-mutable-default-arguments/) site.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install Late
```

## License

**包 Late** is licensed as reads in 
[LICENSE](https://github.com/neogeny/late/blob/master/LICENSE).


## And now... this!

You can use ``包``, the Kanji for _"wrap"_, instead of ``__`` to late-bind
an argument.

```python
@latebinding
def f(x: list[Any] = 包([])) -> list[Any]:
```
