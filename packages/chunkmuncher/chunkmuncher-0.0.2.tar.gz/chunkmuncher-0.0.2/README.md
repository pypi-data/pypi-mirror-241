# ChunkMuncher
Repackaging of the "chunk" module, originally written by Sjoerd Mullender, sjoerd@acm.org
This module, along with some others, has been deprecated, and was removed in Python 3.13.0. As a result, some have decided to repackage modules we use often. This package will be for the chunk module, and I soon will be including the aifc and wave readers and writers. I can see room for improvements, so I plan on doing some.
Pull requests are welcome, as are issue reports.
Upgrades and tests are intended to follow.

## Description from the original documentation

This module provides an interface for reading files that use EA IFF 85
chunks. This format is used in at least the Audio Interchange File
Format (AIFF/AIFF-C) and the Real Media File Format (RMFF). The WAVE
audio file format is closely related and can also be read using this
module.
