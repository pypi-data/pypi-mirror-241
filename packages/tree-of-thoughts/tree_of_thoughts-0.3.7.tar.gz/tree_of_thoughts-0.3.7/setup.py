Each expert will share their thought process in detail, taking into account the previous thoughts of others and admitting any errors. They will iteratively refine and expand upon each other\'s ideas, giving credit where it\'s due. The process continues until a conclusive answer is found. Organize the entire response in a markdown table format.
