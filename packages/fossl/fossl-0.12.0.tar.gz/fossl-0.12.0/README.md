fossl provides descriptions of the most common free open source (FOSS) licenses. Instructions on how to apply a license to the source code are included. The information is obtained from GitHub i.e. is always up-to-date. The license texts for "LICENSE" files can also be downloaded.

Finally,

```sh
% fossl show MIT -text > LICENSE
```

creates a LICENSE file for a new project.

`fossl` can also be used as a Python package, allowing Python code to access license information.

## Limitations

GitHub limits the number of queries a user may make per hour. For unauthenticated users like `fossl`, that [rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limiting) is 60 / hour. `fossl` caches license information locally (`~/.config/fossl.toml`) to work around the rate limit. The license cache is updated every 90 days or if the cache file is deleted.
