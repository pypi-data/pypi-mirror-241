Multiprocessing Proxy Channel
*****************************

:module: cc_mp_proxy

:synopsis: concrete implementation of a multiprocessing proxy channel

CCProxy channel was created, in order to enable the connection of
multiple auxiliaries on one and only one CChannel. This CChannel
has to be used with a so called proxy auxiliary.
