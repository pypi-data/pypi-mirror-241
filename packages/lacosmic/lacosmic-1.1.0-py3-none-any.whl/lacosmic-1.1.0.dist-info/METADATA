lacosmic is a Python package to remove cosmic rays from an
astronomical image using the `L.A.Cosmic algorithm
<http://www.astro.yale.edu/dokkum/lacosmic/>`_.  The algorithm is
based on Laplacian edge detection and is described in `van Dokkum
(2001; PASP 113, 1420)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001PASP..113.1420V/abstract>`_.
