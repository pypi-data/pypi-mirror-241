# ‚ú® panel-modal

We want to make it easy to use *modals* with Panel on both the server and in the notebook.

A *modal* is an element that displays in front of and deactivates all other page content. Panel
already includes a modal. But it only works if you using a *template* on a server. It does not
work in the notebook.

You can install and use the package as simple as.

```bash
pip install panel-modal
```

```python
import panel as pn

from panel_modal import Modal

pn.extension()

modal = Modal(pn.panel("Hi. I am the Panel Modal!", width=200))

pn.Column(modal.param.open, modal).servable()
```
