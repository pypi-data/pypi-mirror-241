This library is for handling notes and chords in Python.

- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/munotes/)
- [API Reference](https://misya11p.github.io/munotes/)

## General Usage

### Note

Note class. Handling note.

This class is used by inputting the note name and octave height, or MIDI note number at initialization.

```python
import munotes as mn

note = mn.Note("A4")
print(note) # A4

note = mn.Note(69)
print(note) # A4
```

- `transpose()`

Transpose the note.

```python
note.transpose(2)
print(note) # B4

```


- `render()`

Get the waveform of the note.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
y = note.render('sin')
plt.plot(y[:200])
```

`squere` and `sawtooth` are also sapported.

```python
y = note.render('squere')
plt.plot(y[:200])
```
![image](docs/images/square.jpg)

```python
y = note.render('sawtooth')
plt.plot(y[:200])
```
![image](docs/images/sawtooth.jpg)

Arbitrary waveforms are also supported.

```python
y = note.render(lambda t: np.sin(t) + np.sin(2*t))
plt.plot(y[:200])
```

- `play()`

Get IPython.display.Audio object.

### Notes

Notes class. Handling multiple notes.

This class is used by inputting the notes at initialization.

```python
notes = mn.Notes("C4", "E4", "G4")
print(notes) # C4 E4 G4

```

Methods are the same as `Note`. Ex: `transpose()`, `render()`, `play()`.



### Chord

Chord class. Handling chord.

This class generates a Notes object by inputting a chord name at initialization.

```python
from munotes import Chord
chord = Chord("A#m7")
print(chord) # A#m7
print(chord.names) # ['A#', 'C#', 'F', 'G#']
```

Methods are the same as `Note` (and `Notes`).  
Transpose is also supported by `transpose()`

```python
chord.transpose(3)
print(chord) # C#m7
print(chord.names) # ['C#', 'E', 'G#', 'B']
```


### Track

Track class. Handling multiple Notes as a sequence.

This class is used by inputting the notes and durations at initialization.


```python
track = mn.Track([
    ("C4", 1),
    ("E4", 1),
    ("G4", 1)
])
```

Methods are the same as other classes.  
But in methods that handling waveform (`render()`, `play()`, etc), generate the waveform as sequence of notes (like: C -> E -> G).


### Stream

Stream class. Handling multiple tracks.

This class is used by inputting the tracks at initialization.

```python
melody = mn.Track([
    ("C4", 1),
    ("D4", 1),
    ("E4", 1)
])

chords = mn.Track([
    (mn.Chord("C"), 3),
])

stream = mn.Stream([melody, chords])
```

Methods are the same as other classes.
