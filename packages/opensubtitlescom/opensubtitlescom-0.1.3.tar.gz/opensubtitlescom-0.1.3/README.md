A Python wrapper for the OpenSubtitles REST API, providing easy access to subtitle data.
This library allows you to interact with OpenSubtitles.com programmatically,
making it simple to search for and download subtitles for your favorite movies and TV shows.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip` directly from PyPI or by cloning the repository from GitHub.

**Install from PyPI:**

```bash
pip install opensubtitlescom
```

**Install from GitHub (latest development version):**

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/dusking/opensubtitles-com.git --upgrade
```

## Usage

Using this wrapper is straightforward.
It follows the OpenSubtitles API documentation closely and converts responses into Python objects.
Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from opensubtitlescom import OpenSubtitles

# Initialize the OpenSubtitles client
subtitles = OpenSubtitles(MY_API_KEY, "MyApp v1.0.0")

# Log in (retrieve auth token)
subtitles.login(MY_USERNAME, MY_PASSWORD)

# Search for subtitles
response = subtitles.search(query="breaking bad", season_number=1, episode_number=1, languages="en")

# Convert the response to a Python dictionary
response_dict = response.to_dict()
print(response_dict)

# Convert the response to a Json format
response_json = response.to_json()
print(response_json)

# Get first response subtitles
srt = subtitles.download_and_parse(response.data[0])
```

Here's another simple example:
```python
# Get latest uploaded subtitles
latest_uploads = subtitles.discover_latest()

# Convert the response to a Python dictionary
latest_uploads_dict = latest_uploads.to_dict()
```


For more information on available methods and options,
