# easytesting 


Easy Testing is a Python library hosted on [Github](https://github.com/IreneSoligno/easy-testing.git) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/easy-testing/) designed to streamline and simplify the testing process for Large Language Model (LLM) applications. 
With a focus on user-friendly functionality, Easy Testing provides a comprehensive suite of tools and utilities for testing the robustness, accuracy, and performance of LLM applications.

This library offers an intuitive interface for writing and executing test cases, allowing developers to assess the functionality of their LLM applications with ease. Easy Testing supports a variety of testing scenarios, including input validation, boundary testing, and performance benchmarking, enabling developers to identify and address potential issues in their applications.
