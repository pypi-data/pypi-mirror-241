`battleship-tui` is merely a Python package and is distributed via PyPI. You can 
install it via `pip` too, but make sure it installs into a venv so that you're not 
messing with the system interpreter.

```shell
# Linux example.
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install battleship-tui[client]
```
