What is CO2MPAS?
****************

CO2MPAS is backward-looking longitudinal-dynamics CO2 and
fuel-consumption simulator for light-duty M1 & N1 vehicles (cars and
vans), specially crafted to *estimate the CO2 emissions of vehicles
undergoing NEDC* testing based on the emissions produced *WLTP
testing* during type-approval, according to the EU legislations
*1152/EUR/2017 and 1153/EUR/2017* (see `History`_ section, below).

It is an open-source project (`EUPL 1.1+
<https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl>`_) developed for
Python-3.6+. It runs either as a *console command* or as a *desktop
GUI application*, and it uses Excel-files or pure python structures
(dictionary and lists) for its input & output data.


History
=======

The *European Commission* has introduced the *WLTP* as the test
procedure for the type I test of the European type-approval of
Light-duty vehicles as of September 2017. Its introduction has
required the adaptation of CO2 certification and monitoring procedures
set by European regulations (443/2009, 510/2011, 1152/EUR/2017 and
1153/EUR/2017). European Commissionâ€™s *Joint Research Centre* (JRC)
has been assigned the development of this vehicle simulator to
facilitate this adaptation.

The European Regulation setting the conditions for using CO2MPAS can
be found in `the Comitology Register
<http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=search.documentdetail&dos_id=0&ds_id=45835&version=2>`_
after its adoption by the *Climate Change Committee* which took place
on June 23, 2016, and its 2nd vote for modifications, in April 27,
2017.


Installation
************

To install CO2MPAS use (with root privileges):

.. code:: console

   $ pip install co2mpas

Or download the latest git version and use (with root privileges):

.. code:: console

   $ python setup.py install

Some additional functionality is enabled installing the following
extras:

*  ``cli``: enables the command line interface.

*  ``sync``: enables the time series synchronization tool (i.e.,
   `syncing <https://github.com/vinci1it2000/syncing>`_ previously
   named ``datasync``).

*  ``gui``: enables the graphical user interface.

*  ``plot``: enables to plot the CO2MPAS model and the workflow of
   each run.

*  ``io``: enables to read/write excel files.

*  ``driver``: enables the driver model (currently is not available).

To install co2mpas and all extras, do:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install 'co2mpas[all]'
