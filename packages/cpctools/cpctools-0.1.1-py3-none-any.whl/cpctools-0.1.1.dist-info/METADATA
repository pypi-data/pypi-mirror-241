### **We are no longer developing in this project. Future works will be in [dynsight](https://github.com/GMPavanLab/dynsight).**


`cpctools` is a python 3.8/3.9/3.10 library aimed at simplifying the analysis of Molecular Dynamics simulations.

_cpctools_ stands for **C**omputational **P**hysical **C**hemistry **TOOLS**, or, if you prefer, for **C**hemical **P**hysics **C**omputational **TOOLS**.

It contains two packages, `SOAPify` and `SOAPify.HDF5er`.

`cpctools` uses `h5py` to store the trajectories, the SOAP fingerprints, and the analysis results in a binary format, facilitated by `HDF5er`.

The documentation is available on [read the docs](https://soapify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). There you can consult the documentation for each available version of the package.

## How To Install

To install the stable version of `cpctools` just type:
```bash
pip install cpctools
```

If you want to use _dscribe_ or _quippy_ for calculating the SOAP features you should install them separately, since they are quite heavy packages on their own, and usually you would use only one of these packages:

```bash
pip install "dscribe<=1.2.2,>1.2.0"
pip install "quippy-ase==0.9.10"
```

### package: SOAPify

This package contains:
 - a toolbox to calculate the [SOAP fingerprints](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.184115) of a system of atoms. The principal aim is to simplify the setup of the calculation. This toolbox depends on `dscribe` or `quippy` and 'unify' the output of the two codes.
 - a toolbox to calculate the distances between SOAP fingerprints
 - a simple analysis tool for trajectories of classified atoms


### package: SOAPify.HDF5er

This package is a toolbox to create [hdf5 files](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) with [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) from the trajectory and topology files. The format we use **do not** align with [h5md](https://www.nongnu.org/h5md/h5md.html)

Our format is thought to speed up the calculations without occupying too much RAM, thanks to the hdf5 dataset chunking capabilities.
- The data within the files are organized into Group categories:
    - "Trajectories" contains subgroups that represent the various stored trajectories, each trajectory subgroup contains three datasets:
      - "Types" contains the types of atoms in the simulation
      - "Box" contains the history of the box dimensions
      - "Trajectory" contains the history of the particle positions
    - "SOAP" group contains the Dastasets of the calculated SOAP fingerprints, each SOAP Dataset contains attributes with the settings to reproduce the results.
    - "Classification" contain a group per trajectory, the format of the Dataset contained within is not fixed
- The user can choose to use a single file per project or to store separately the results of the various steps of the analysis project (this is more recommended).
SOAPify.HDF5er contains a tool for exporting the trajectories from the hdf5 file to [extended xyz](https://www.ovito.org/docs/current/reference/file_formats/input/xyz.html#extended-xyz-format) format, compatible with [ovito](https://www.ovito.org/)
