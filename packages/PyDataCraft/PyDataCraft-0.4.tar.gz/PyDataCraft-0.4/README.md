Python application to manipulate, convert & view different and different Scientific data.

**Inside the project folder (PyDataCraft)/DATA you can find a "test_data" repository with inside files to test the applicative.**

## Installation

- **The best way** is to install the entire environment manually (which I called "myenv" in the example below). To do so please to run the code in the following order:

  ```
  conda create --name myenv (consider to use python>=3.8)
  ```

  Activate the environmet created above with:

  ```
  conda activate myenv
  ```

  Now time to install all the dependencies needed by following the order of the commands below:

  ```
  sudo apy get install gmt
  sudo apt get install cdo
  conda install -c conda-forge gmt geopandas 
  pip install PyDataCraft

  ```

**No matter which path you followed, now you have all the packages needed instaled in your envirnment and the GPSconverter Application installed too!** 

**To run the application just type on your terminal/command-propt the following:**

```
PyDataCraft
```

At this point a GUI interface will pop up and you are ready to go!
