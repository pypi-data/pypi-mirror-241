# ISO Week Date

**iso-week-date** is a toolkit to work with strings representing [ISO Week date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) in two formats, namely:

- Week format **YYYY-WNN** (corresponding to the date format **%Y-W%V**)
- Week date format **YYYY-WNN-D** (corresponding to the date format **%Y-W%V-%u**)

(where YYYY represents the year, W is a literal, NN represents the week number, and D represents the day of the week)

In a nutshell it provides:

- [`IsoWeek`](api/isoweek.md) and [`IsoWeekDate`](api/isoweekdate.md) classes implementing a series of methods to work with ISO Week (Date) formats and avoiding the pitfalls of going back and forth between string, date and datetime python objects
- [pandas](api/pandas.md) and [polars](api/polars.md) functionalities to work with series of ISO Week dates
