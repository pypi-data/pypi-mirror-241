What's new
==========

**Config File Support**
 Load configuration values from a custom file to override default values. To use this feature, use the new `--config_file` parameter to specify the configuration file path.
 This enhancement is available in the following scripts:

 * `apply_configuration_values_to_target_env.py`
 * `continue_deployment_to_target_env.py`
 * `deploy_apps_to_target_env_with_airgap.py`
 * `deploy_latest_tags_to_target_env.py`
 * `deploy_tags_to_target_env_with_manifest.py`
 * `evaluate_test_results.py`
 * `fetch_apps_packages.py`
 * `fetch_lifetime_data.py`
 * `scan_test_endpoints.py`
 * `start_deployment_to_target_env.py`
 * `tag_apps_based_on_manifest_data.py`
 * `tag_modified_apps.py`

**SSL Certificate Verification**
 The Python `requests` module verifies SSL certificates for HTTPS requests.
 Now there's a flag to enable (default value) or disable SSL certificate verification.

**Fetch Technical Debt**
 Enhanced the `fetch_tech_debt` script to prevent failures when all modules of an app are marked as 'ignored' in AI Mentor Studio and when an app has no security findings.

**Tag Modified Applications**
 Updated `tag_modified_apps` script to tag applications based on a app_list parameter or from the trigger_manifest artifact
