    ```
    from sao_download import download as sd
    sd.download_models('models', ['gpt2'])
    ```
  #### And then, the whole gpt2 model in pytorch will be stored in "models" direct.
- ### Batch Download pytorch models from Hugging Face
    ```
    from sao_download import download as sd
    sd.download_models('models', ['roberta-base', 'gpt2', 'bert-base-uncased'])
    ```
  #### This code will download roberta-base、 gpt2、 bert-base-uncased into "models"
