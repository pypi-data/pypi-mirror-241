# tooltils | v1.5.0

[![python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/tooltils.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/tooltils/)
[![downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/tooltils?period=total&units=international_system&left_color=grey&right_color=red&left_text=downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/tooltils)

A lightweight python utility package built on the standard library

```py
>>> import tooltils
>>> req = tooltils.requests.get('httpbin.org/get/')
>>> req
'<GET httpbin.org [200]>'
>>> req.url
'https://httpbin.org/get'
>>> req.status_code
'200 OK'
>>> req.headers["User-Agent"]
'Python-tooltils/1.5.0'
```

## Installation

Get the latest version from PyPi

```console
python -m pip install tooltils
```

OR build it directly from the source

```console
git clone https://github.com/feetbots/tooltils.git
cd tooltils
python -m pip install !setup.py --user
```

## API

The full API is available to read in the project files at [**API.md**](API.md)

## Planned Features

- Add a base-level implementation of the `requests` module using only the `socket` and `ssl` modules
- Add a feature in the `info` module to specify methods or variables as config values
- Rewrite older messy code

## Important Note

The current implementation for the cache and config, opens the data file once if used, then the code will use that TextIOWrapper to write and read etc. Unfortunately, there is no native method of closing this method once the program has ended, leaving this up to CPython's garbage collecter. This method is considered bad practice but should be better than constantly opening and closing each file.
