 * \mainpage cuTENSOR: A High-Performance CUDA Library for Tensor Primitives
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * \subsection nomen Nomenclature
 *
 * The term tensor refers to an \b order-n (a.k.a.,
 * n-dimensional) array. One can think of tensors as a generalization of
 * matrices to higher \b orders.

 * For example, scalars, vectors, and matrices are
 * order-0, order-1, and order-2 tensors, respectively.
 *
 * An order-n tensor has n \b modes. Each mode has an \b extent (a.k.a. size).
 * Each mode you can specify a \b stride s > 0. This \b stride
 * describes offset of two logically consecutive elements in physical (i.e., linearized) memory.
 * This is similar to the leading-dimension in BLAS.

 * cuTENSOR, by default, adheres to a generalized \b column-major data layout.
 * For example: \f$A_{a,b,c} \in {R}^{4\times 8 \times 12}\f$
 * is an order-3 tensor with the extent of the a-mode, b-mode, and c-mode
 * respectively being 4, 8, and 12. If not explicitly specified, the strides are
 * assumed to be: stride(a) = 1, stride(b) = extent(a), stride(c) = extent(a) *
 * extent(b).

 * For a general order-n tensor \f$A_{i_1,i_2,...,i_n}\f$ we require that the strides do
 * not lead to overlapping memory accesses; for instance, \f$stride(i_1) \geq 1\f$, and
 * \f$stride(i_l) \geq stride(i_{l-1}) * extent(i_{l-1})\f$.

 * We say that a tensor is \b packed if it is contiguously stored in memory along all
 * modes. That is, \f$ stride(i_1) = 1\f$ and \f$stride(i_l) =stride(i_{l-1}) *
 * extent(i_{l-1})\f$).
 *
 * \subsection einsum Einstein Notation
 * We adhere to the "Einstein notation": Modes that appear in the input
 * tensors, and that do not appear in the output tensor, are implicitly
 * contracted.

/**
 * \brief Initializes the cuTENSOR library and allocates the memory for the library context.
 *
 * \details The device associated with a particular cuTENSOR handle is assumed to remain
 * unchanged after the cutensorCreate() call. In order for the cuTENSOR library to
 * use a different device, the application must set the new device to be used by
 * calling cudaSetDevice() and then create another cuTENSOR handle, which will
 * be associated with the new device, by calling cutensorCreate().
 *
 * The user is responsible for calling cutensorDestroy(handle) to free the resources associated
 * to the handle.

/**
 * \brief Element-wise tensor operation with three inputs
 *
 * \details This function performs a element-wise tensor operation of the form:
 * \f[ D_{\Pi^C(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)} = \Phi_{ABC}(\Phi_{AB}(\alpha \Psi_A(A_{\Pi^A(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)}), \beta \Psi_B(B_{\Pi^B(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)})), \gamma \Psi_C(C_{\Pi^C(i_0,i_1,...,i_n)})) \f]
 *
 * Where
 *    - A,B,C,D are multi-mode tensors (of arbitrary data types).
 *    - \f$\Pi^A, \Pi^B, \Pi^C \f$ are permutation operators that permute the modes of A, B, and C respectively.
 *    - \f$\Psi_{A},\Psi_{B},\Psi_{C}\f$ are unary element-wise operators (e.g., IDENTITY, CONJUGATE).
 *    - \f$\Phi_{ABC}, \Phi_{AB}\f$ are binary element-wise operators (e.g., ADD, MUL, MAX, MIN).
 *
 * Notice that the broadcasting (of a mode) can be achieved by simply omitting that mode from the respective tensor.
 *
 * Moreover, modes may appear in any order, giving users a greater flexibility. The only <b>restrictions</b> are:
 *    - modes that appear in A or B _must_ also appear in the output tensor; a mode that only appears in the input would be contracted and such an operation would be covered by either cutensorContraction or cutensorReduction.
 *    - each mode may appear in each tensor at most once.
 *
 * Input tensors may be read even if the value
 * of the corresponding scalar is zero.
 *
 * Examples:
 *    - \f$ D_{a,b,c,d} = A_{b,d,a,c}\f$
 *    - \f$ D_{a,b,c,d} = 2.2 * A_{b,d,a,c} + 1.3 * B_{c,b,d,a}\f$
 *    - \f$ D_{a,b,c,d} = 2.2 * A_{b,d,a,c} + 1.3 * B_{c,b,d,a} + C_{a,b,c,d}\f$
 *    - \f$ D_{a,b,c,d} = min((2.2 * A_{b,d,a,c} + 1.3 * B_{c,b,d,a}), C_{a,b,c,d})\f$
 *

 * For example this function enables users to reduce an entire tensor to a scalar: C[] = alpha * A[i,j,k];
 *
 * This function is also able to perform partial reductions; for instance: C[i,j] = alpha * A[k,j,i]; in this case only elements along the k-mode are contracted.
 *
 * The binary opReduce operator provides extra control over what kind of a reduction
 * ought to be perfromed. For instance, opReduce == CUTENSOR_OP_ADD reduces element of A
 * via a summation while CUTENSOR_OP_MAX would find the largest element in A.
