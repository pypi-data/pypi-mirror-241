# nano-keras

## Overview

### **nano-keras** is a compact implementation of [Keras](https://keras.io/) using only Python and NumPy. It's designed with the primary aim of deepening understanding about neural network fundamentals and their implementation at a lower level. While it might not match the speed or feature-rich capabilities of Keras, it serves as an educational project to explore the inner workings of neural networks

## Key Features

### - Simplicity: Built using fundamental Python and NumPy functionalities, emphasizing simplicity and readability

### - Educational: Intended as a learning tool to understand neural network components at a lower level

### - Customization: Allows for tinkering and understanding the core mechanics of neural network operations

## Instalation

### You will be able to download it from PyPI after around 12th of Noveber and I will explain how to do it then

## Documentation

### Currently, the documentation is in progress and is expected to be released along with the first version on November 12th. It will cover:

#### - Installation instructions

#### - Usage examples

#### - Explanation of classes and methods
