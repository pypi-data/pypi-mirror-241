# setuptools-scm puts all tracked files here already. We need to
# prune files we don't want in our sdist, and include generated files
# Ideally we can simply just *include* files we want, but I have given up
# on that for now.

# Add generated files
graft jupyterhub_fancy_profiles/static/dist

# Remove JS files that we won't need when installed
exclude src/*
exclude webpack.config.js

# Remove docs & dev time needs we won't need when installed in sdist
exclude CONTRIBUTING.md
exclude dev-requirements.txt
exclude jupyterhub_config.py
exclude binderhub_config.py
exclude package.json
exclude screenshot.png
