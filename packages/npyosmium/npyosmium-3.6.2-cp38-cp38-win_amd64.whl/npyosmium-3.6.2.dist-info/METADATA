=========
npyosmium
=========

npyosmium is a fork of pyosmium, adding some numpy efficient interface.

This library provides Python bindings for the `Libosmium`_ C++
library, a library for working with OpenStreetMap data in a fast and flexible
manner.

.. _Libosmium: https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium

Installation
============

npyosmium can be installed with pip:

    pip install npyosmium

The Pypi source package already comes bundled with a matching version of
libosmium, protozero and pybind11. npyosmium additionally depends on
expat, libz, libbz2 and Boost variant and iterator. You need to install
development packages for these libraries. On Debian/Ubuntu do::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libboost-dev \
                       libexpat1-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev


Python >= 3.7 is supported. Pypy is known not to work.

Documentation
=============

The documentation for the latest release is available at
`osmcode.org`_.

If you find bugs or have feature requests, please report those in the
`Github issue tracker`_. For general questions about using pyosmium you
can contanct the `OSM development mailing list`_ or ask on `OSM help`_.
