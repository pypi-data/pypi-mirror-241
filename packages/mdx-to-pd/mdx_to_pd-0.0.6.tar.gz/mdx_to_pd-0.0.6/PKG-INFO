        """
# returns pd.DataFrame()

df = mdx_retriever(query, connection)

# mdx or dax query can be provided
# returns df based on mdx query with column names with whitespace replaced by '_'
# to return own column whitespace replacement string, add parameter 

df = mdx_retriever(query, connection,'-')

# in case of error due to missing Microsoft.PowerBI.AdomdClient.dll
# please follow prompts in terminal.
# package expects file located in 
# c:\Program Files\Microsoft Power BI Desktop\bin\ but path is not
# existing it will search for the file on c: drive and will suggest to add this as parameter

# all options:
mdx_retriever(
     query: str, # mdx query
     conn:str, # connection to OLAP CUBE,
     whitespace_replacer: str #optional replacement string for column whitespaces
