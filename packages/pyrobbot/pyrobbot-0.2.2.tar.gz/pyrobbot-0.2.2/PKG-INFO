# pyRobBot: Talk and Chat with GPT LLMs

An interface to OpenAI's [GPT large language models (LLMs)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) that implements:
* A conventional chatbot that can be used either via web UI or terminal
* A personal assistant that can actually interact with you by voice

The package is written in Python. The web chatbot UI is made with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

**See and try the [demo web app on Streamlit](https://pyrobbot.streamlit.app)!**

## Features
- [x] Text to speech and speech to text (`rob voice`)
  - Talk to the GPT assistant!
  - You can choose your preferred language (e.g., `rob voice --lang pt-br`)
- [x] Web UI
  - Add/remove conversations dynamically
  - Automatic/editable conversation summary title
- [x] Fully configurable
  - Support for multiple GPT LLMs
  - Control over the parameters passed to the OpenAI API, with (hopefully) sensible defaults
  - Ability to pass base directives to the LLM
    - E.g., to make it adopt a persona, but you decide which directived to pass
  - Dynamically modifiable AI parameters in each chat separately
    - No need to restart the chat
- [x] Autosave & retrieve chat history
- [x] Chat context handling using [embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)
- [x] Estimated API token usage and associated costs
- [x] OpenAI API key is **never** stored on disk



## System Requirements
- Python >= 3.9
- A valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
  - Set in the Web UI or through the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Optionally, to enable voice chat, you also need:
  - [PortAudio](https://www.portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/index.html)
    - Install on Ubuntu with `sudo apt-get --assume-yes install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev`
    - Install on CentOS/RHEL with `sudo yum install portaudio portaudio-devel`

## Installation
This, naturally, assumes your systems fulfills all [requirements](#system-requirements).
### Using pip
```shell
pip install pyrobbot
```

### From source
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/paulovcmedeiros/pyRobBot.git
```

## Basic Usage
Upon succesfull installation, you should be able to run
```shell
rob [opts] SUBCOMMAND [subcommand_opts]
```
where `[opts]` and `[subcommand_opts]` denote optional command line arguments
that apply, respectively, to `rob` in general and to `SUBCOMMAND`
specifically.

**Please run `rob -h` for information** about the supported subcommands
and general `rob` options. For info about specific subcommands and the
options that apply to them only, **please run `rob SUBCOMMAND -h`** (note
that the `-h` goes after the subcommand in this case).


### Using the Web UI
```shell
rob
```

### Chatting by Voice
```shell
rob voice
```

### Running on the Terminal
```shell
rob .
```

## Disclaimers
This project's main purpose is to serve as a learning exercise for me, as well as tool for experimenting with OpenAI API, GPT LLMs and text-to-voice/voice-to-text. It does not claim to be the best or more robust OpenAI-powered chatbot out there.

Having said this, this project *does* aim to provide a friendly user interface that is easy to use and configure. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you find a bug or have a suggestion.

Last but not least: this project is **not** affiliated with OpenAI in any way.
