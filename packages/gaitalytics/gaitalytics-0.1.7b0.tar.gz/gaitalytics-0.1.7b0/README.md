This Python package provides a comprehensive set of tools and advanced algorithms for analyzing 3D motion capture data.
It is specifically designed to process gait data stored in c3d format. Prior to utilizing the features of gaitalytics,
it is necessary to perform data labeling, modeling, and filtering procedures.

The library's versatility allows it to be adaptable to various marker sets and modeling algorithms,
offering high configurability.

> **Note**
> Current pre-release is only tested with data acquired with Motek Caren, HBM2 Lower Body Trunk and PIG.

## Usage

### Installation

Please be aware of the dependency of gaitalytics to Biomechanical-ToolKit (BTK). To install follow the
instructions [here](https://biomechanical-toolkit.github.io/docs/Wrapping/Python/_build_instructions.html) or use
conda-forge
version [here](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/btk)

Fast install with anaconda:

````shell
pip install gaitalytics
conda install -c conda-forge btk
````

### Configuration

Gaitalytics can be used with any marker set, which at least includes four hip markers (left front/back, right
front/back)
and four foot markers (left heel/toe, right heel/toe) and four ankle makers (left medial/lateral, right medial lateral).

All functionalities in the libraries only take points into account which are configured in as specific yaml file. 
Working example file can be found [here](https://github.com/cereneo-foundation/gaitalytics/blob/94bbc73072535d7f1e53ea935b6145194b137f09/settings/hbm_pig.yaml)
