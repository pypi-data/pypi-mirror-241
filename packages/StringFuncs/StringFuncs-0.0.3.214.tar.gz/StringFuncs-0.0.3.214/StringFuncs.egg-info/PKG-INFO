## StringFuncs README

This is more of a pratice package for general functions that I might use for basic string manipulation using python. I will be updating the package as I continue college. 

> That being said anybody can use the project and contrusctive critism is highly encouraged.

To access the functions simply install the package using: 

`pip install StringFuncs`

and import the functions like so:
 
`from StringFuncs import StringFunctions`

You can now use the functions like so:

`print((string_funcs("This.is.a.Testing.String.3Cool3", separator=".")).chars_as_list())`

> or you can  

`print((string_funcs("Hello World!!!", separator=" ")).get_last_word())`

If you need help I have included doc strings detailing each function.
I am planning on adding more functions and improving existing functions as I go through college.
While this project is for string manipulation, I plan on adding a vast amount of functions that might prove useful.
