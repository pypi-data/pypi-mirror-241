![HK4CRPRASAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hk4crprasad/ph/master/HK4CRPRASAD_free-file.png)

This Python script unleashes the power of Telethon to create a Telegram bot with robust flood control. 🚧 It monitors incoming messages, executes swift actions, and plays the game by its own rules.

## 🚀 Features

- **Flood Control:** Monitors messages, strikes back when they exceed limits.
- **Muting and Blocking:** Sends a silent message, plays the waiting game, and then unleashes the block hammer.
- **Non-blocking List:** Certain VIPs get a free pass. 🌟

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Telethon library
- Telegram API credentials (api_id and api_hash)

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install telethon requests
   ```

2. Configure your Telegram API credentials at runtime

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   pip install pirobot
   pirobot
   ```

## ⚡ Configuration

- Tweak the `max_flood_attempts` to unleash the chaos upon flooders.
- Add user IDs to `excluded_channel_ids` and create your VIP list.
