        Perform an inference.

        The `inputs` parameter represents a batch of inputs to send to the
        model. If the model supports batch, then it will process the inputs in
        groups according to its batch size. If the model does not support batch,
        then it will loop through each input and process it individually.

        Each input in `inputs` is a dictionary that allows multiple pieces of
        data to be supplied to the model for each discrete inference. The key
        should match the key name expected by the model (e.g. the first value
        supplied in the [ChassisModel.metadata.add_input]
        [chassis.metadata.ModelMetadata.add_input] method)
        and the value should always be of type `bytes`. The bytes should be
        decodable using one of the model's declared media type for that key
        (e.g. the `accepted_media_types` argument in
        [ChassisModel.metadata.add_input]
        [chassis.metadata.ModelMetadata.add_input]).

        To enable drift detection and/or explainability on models that support
        it, you can set the appropriate parameters to `True`.

        In the `RunResponse` object, you will be given a similar structure to
        the inputs. The `outputs` property will be an array that corresponds to
        the batch of inputs. The index of each item in `outputs` will be the
        inference result for the corresponding index in the `inputs` array. And
        similarly to inputs, each inference result will be a dictionary that
        can return multiple pieces of data per inference. The key and media
        type of the bytes value should match the values supplied in
        [ChassisModel.metadata.add_input]
        [chassis.metadata.ModelMetadata.add_input]).

        Args:
            inputs: The batch of inputs to supply to the model. See above for
