        A highly configurable, dynamic, fast, and easy solution to managing
        a command-line application. The goal is to make cli development as simple
        and effective as possible for any configuration enabling the developer to
        focus on function over form.
        
        Supports Python >= 3.7 and can run asynchronously or synchronously.
        
        This library took heavy initial inspiration by [urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli)
        so credit to them for their work as well.
