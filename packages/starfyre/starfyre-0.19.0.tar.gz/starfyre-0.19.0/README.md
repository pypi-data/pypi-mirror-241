# Starfyre ‚≠êüî•

## Introduction:

Starfyre is a library that allows you to build reactive frontends using only Python. With Starfyre, you can create interactive, real-time applications with minimal effort. Simply define your frontend as a collection of observables and reactive functions, and let Starfyre handle the rest.



## üì¶ Installation:

```
pip install starfyre
```

A sample project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sansyrox/first-starfyre-app/).

## üöÄ Sample App

To create an application

```bash
python3 -m starfyre --create="my-app"
```


`my-app/src/__init__.fyre`
```python

from .parent import parent
from .store import store

def mocked_request():
  return "fetched on the server"


async def handle_on_click(e):
  alert("click rendered on client")
  if 1==1:
    print("Hello world")

  current_value = get_parent_signal()
  set_parent_signal(current_value + 1)
  a = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  print(await a.text())
  print("handles on click")
  

<style>
  body {
    background-color: red;
  }
</style>

<pyxide>
  <store>
    <parent hello='world'>
        <span onclick={handle_on_click}>
          {[ mocked_request() for i in range(4)]}
        </span>
    </parent>
  </store>
</pyxide>


<script>
// this is the optional section 
// for third party scripts and custom js
</script>

```

      serve (bool): Whether to serve the project.

Options:
  --path TEXT    Path to the project. Requires --build.
  --build        Compile and build package. Requires --path.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Developing Locally

Python version 3.10

1. Fork this [repo](https://github.com/sparckles/starfyre)
2. Clone this repo - `git clone https://github.com/sparckles/starfyre`
3. Go in to the starfyre directory - `cd starfyre`
4. Download poetry `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org/ | python3 -`
5. Install the dependencies `poetry install`
6. Activate poetry virtual environment `poetry shell`
7. Run the script `./build.sh`. This command will run the build process in starfyre against the test application in `test-application` directory.
  - The `build.sh` file is a simple script that runs two commands sequentially.
    - `python -m starfyre --build=True --path="test_application/"`
        - The `path` variable here is the path to our application.
        - The `build` directory is basically a python package that contains all the compiled files. We use the `--build` flag to run that package.

8. You can find a small test application in the `test_application` directory.
9. Navigate to `cd test_application/dist`.
10. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the output.
