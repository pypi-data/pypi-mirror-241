## Introduction

This package provides a convenient and easy-to-use Python interface for the Upgrade.Chat API, allowing developers to integrate Upgrade.Chat's services into their applications. Upgrade.Chat is a platform that facilitates monetization for community services, and this wrapper aims to simplify the automation of tasks such as managing orders, products, and users.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
pip install upchatpy
```

## Usage

Before you can start using the API, you need to obtain your client ID and client secret from Upgrade.Chat. Once you have them, you can begin by creating a `Client` instance:

```python
from upgrade_chat import Client

client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'

client = Client(client_id, client_secret)
```

### Authentication

The wrapper handles authentication automatically when making API calls. However, you can manually authenticate and retrieve the access token as follows:

```python
await client.get_auth()
print(client.access_token)  # Access token is now available
```

### Fetching Orders

To fetch orders, use the following method:

```python
orders_response = await client.get_orders()
for order in orders_response.data:
    print(order.uuid, order.total)
```

### Fetching Products

Retrieve a list of products using:

```python
products_response = await client.get_products()
for product in products_response.data:
    print(product.uuid, product.name)
```

### Fetching Users

To get a list of users, you can do:

```python
users_response = await client.get_users()
for user in users_response.data:
    print(user.discord_id, user.username)
```

## Exception Handling

The Upgrade.Chat Python Wrapper provides custom exceptions to help you handle potential errors that may occur during API interaction.

### Custom Exceptions

- `AuthenticationError`: Raised when there is a problem with client authentication, such as incorrect client ID or client secret.
- `HTTPError`: Raised for general HTTP-related errors when making API requests.
- `ResourceNotFoundError`: Raised when a requested resource is not found on the Upgrade.Chat API.

### Example Usage

```python
from upgrade_chat import Client
from upgrade_chat.exceptions import AuthenticationError, HTTPError, ResourceNotFoundError

client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
client = Client(client_id, client_secret)

async def main():
    try:
        orders_response = await client.get_orders()
        for order in orders_response.data:
            print(order.uuid, order.total)
    except AuthenticationError as e:
        print(f"Authentication failed with status code {e.status_code}: {e.message}")
    except ResourceNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Resource not found with status code {e.status_code}: {e.message}")
    except HTTPError as e:
        print(f"HTTP error with status code {e.status_code}: {e.message}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
