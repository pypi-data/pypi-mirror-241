## **Overview** 📜

**ML-STAC** provides a unified structure for cataloguing, describing, and adapting Earth Observation (EO) datasets into a format optimised for training Machine Learning (ML) models. Check the simple usage of `mlstac` here:

```python
import mlstac

# Create a Dataset using the ML-STAC specification
json_file = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/jfloresf/demo/raw/main/main.json"
train_db = mlstac.load(json_file, framework="torch", stream=False, device="cpu")
print(train_db[4])

# {'input': tensor([[[ 6.3199,  6.3629,  6.4148,  ..., 10.4104, 10.5109, 10.3847],
#           [ 6.3850,  6.3615,  6.4166,  ..., 10.4540, 10.4384, 10.4554],
#           [ 6.3519,  6.3176,  6.3575,  ..., 10.4247, 10.4618, 10.4257]]]),
#  'target': tensor([[[ 6.3199,  6.3629,  6.4148,  ..., 10.4104, 10.5109, 10.3847],
#           [ 6.3850,  6.3615,  6.4166,  ..., 10.4540, 10.4384, 10.4554],
#           [ 6.3519,  6.3176,  6.3575,  ..., 10.4247, 10.4618, 10.4257]]])
# }
```

**ML-STAC** is strongly influenced by the [STAC](https://stacspec.org/en) specification and its extensions, [single-file-stac](https://github.com/stac-extensions/single-file-stac) (Deprecated), [TrainingDML-AI](https://github.com/TrainingDML/trainingdml-ai-extension/tree/main) and [ML AOI](https://github.com/stac-extensions/ml-aoi#ml-aoi-extension). Additionally, we have incorporated naming conventions as discussed in the [OGC Training Data Markup Language - AI Conceptual Model Standard](https://github.com/opengeospatial/TrainingDML-AI_SWG).

## **Is ML-STAC an STAC Extension?** 🤔

Within the ML-STAC specification, each dataset is treated as an [STAC Collection](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/collection-spec/collection-spec.md). Learn more at [STAC-ML](https://github.com/IPL-UV/ML-STAC/tree/main/mlstac/collection). However, each sample or element within that dataset is not considered an [STAC Item](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/item-spec.md). Instead, we propose a new data structure called [ML-STAC Sample](https://github.com/IPL-UV/ML-STAC/tree/main/mlstac/sample), which is optimized for efficient read access to a wide range of data types, including images, text, and video.

## **The ML-STAC specification** 📋

The ML-STAC Specification consists of 2 interrelated specifications.

<img align="right" width="50%" src="./mlstac/assets/img/structure.png">

- **[ML-STAC Sample](./mlstac/sample/specification.md)** is the core atomic unit, representing a single data sample as [safetensor](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) file.

-  **[ML-STAC Collection](./mlstac/collection/specification.md)**, is an extension for STAC Collections that aggregates information about ML tasks, licenses, providers, and more. Each ML-STAC Collection must contain three [Catalog](./mlstac/catalog/README.md) objects: train, validation, and test.

Additionally, the ML-STAC specification includes an [API](./mlstac/api/README.md) interface, giving users on-demand access to datasets that 
conform to the ML-STAC specification.

## **How can I adapt my dataset to align with the ML-STAC specification?** 🔧

The process is straightforward for the vast majority of EO ML datasets. Here are the typical steps we follow.

1. Check to which [ML Task]() your dataset fixes better, we currently support more than 10 different tasks including multi-modal cases.
2. Create a generic dataloader (iterator object) using your favourite framework.
3. Use the [ml-stac toolbox]() and the iterator object (from step 2) to create [safetensors]() easily.
4. Move your dataset to your favourite file storage system (e.g. Local, AWS S3, Hugging Face Datasets, Azure Blob Storage, etc.).
5. Create a ML-STAC Collection object. We highly recommend you use `mlstac.collection.datamodel` validators.
6. Success! Remember that `mlstac` is multi-framework, so you can load your dataset in your favourite framework
   without needing additional dependencies (we currently support `torch`, `tensorflow`, `paddle`, `jax` and `numpy`).
