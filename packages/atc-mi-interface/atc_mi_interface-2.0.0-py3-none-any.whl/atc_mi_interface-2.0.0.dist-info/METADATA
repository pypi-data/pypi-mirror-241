__Python tools and API for the "atc1441" and "pvvx" Xiaomi Mijia Thermometer custom firmware__

Python components (API and command-line tools, including some GUI) to represent
the data model of the BLE advertisements of the Xiaomi Mijia Thermometer custom
firmware (ATC_MiThermometer) developed by
[atc1441](https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer)
and [pvvx](https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer). When using the latest
releases of the "pvvx" firmware, it also allows to read and write the
firmware configuration parameters.

A documented interface and a testing tool are included to receive, decode,
show, build and edit the BLE advertisements.

Installation without GUI:

```
pip install [ -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ] atc-mi-interface
```

Installation including wxPython prerequisites for the GUI:

```
pip install [ -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ] atc-mi-interface[gui]
```
