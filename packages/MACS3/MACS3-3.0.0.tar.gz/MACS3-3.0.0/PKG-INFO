## Introduction

With the improvement of sequencing techniques, chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq)
is getting popular to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. To
address the lack of powerful ChIP-Seq analysis method, we presented
the **M**odel-based **A**nalysis of **C**hIP-**S**eq (MACS), for
identifying transcript factor binding sites. MACS captures the
influence of genome complexity to evaluate the significance of
enriched ChIP regions and MACS improves the spatial resolution of
binding sites through combining the information of both sequencing tag
position and orientation. MACS can be easily used for ChIP-Seq data
alone, or with a control sample with the increase of
specificity. Moreover, as a general peak-caller, MACS can also be
applied to any "DNA enrichment assays" if the question to be asked is
simply: *where we can find significant reads coverage than the random
background*.

##  Changes for MACS (3.0.0)

1) Call variants in peak regions directly from BAM files. The
	function was originally developed under code name SAPPER. Now
	SAPPER has been merged into MACS as the `callvar` command. It can
	be used to call SNVs and small INDELs directly from alignment
	files for ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq. We call `fermi-lite` to assemble
	the DNA sequence at the enriched genomic regions (binding sites or
	accessible DNA) and to refine the alignment when necessary. We
	added `simde` as	a submodule in order to support fermi-lite
	library under non-x64 architectures.

2) HMMRATAC module is added as subcommand `hmmratac`. HMMRATAC is a
	dedicated software to analyze ATAC-seq data. The basic idea behind
	HMMRATAC is to digest ATAC-seq data according to the fragment
	length of read pairs into four signal tracks: short fragments,
	mono-nucleosomal fragments, di-nucleosomal fragments and
	tri-nucleosomal fragments. Then integrate the four tracks again
	using Hidden Markov Model to consider three hidden states: open
	region, nucleosomal region, and background region. The orginal
	paper was published in 2019 written in JAVA, by Evan Tarbell. We
	implemented it in Python/Cython and optimize the whole process
	using existing MACS functions and hmmlearn. Now it can run much
	faster than the original JAVA version. Note: evaluation of the
	peak calling results is still underway.

3) Speed/memory optimization.  Use the cykhash to replace python
	dictionary. Use buffer (10MB) to read and parse input file (not
	available for BAM file parser). And many optimization tweaks. We
	added memory monitoring to the runtime messages.

4) R wrappers for MACS -- MACSr for bioconductor.

5) Code cleanup. Reorganize source codes. 

6) Unit testing. 

7) Switch to Github Action for CI, support multi-arch testing
	including x64, armv7, aarch64, s390x and ppc64le. We also test on
	Mac OS 12.

8) MACS tag-shifting model has been refined. Now it will use a naive
	peak calling approach to find ALL possible paired peaks at + and -
	strand, then use all of them to calculate the
	cross-correlation. (a related bug has been fix
	[#442](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS/issues/442))

9) BAI index and random access to BAM file now is
	supported. [#449](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS/issues/449).

10) Support of Python > 3.10 [#498](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS/issues/498)

11) The effective genome size parameters have been updated
	according to deeptools. [#508](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS/issues/508)

12) Multiple updates regarding dependencies, anaconda built, CI/CD
	process.

13) Cython 3 is supported.

14) Documentations for each subcommand can be found under /docs

*Other*

1) Missing header line while no peaks can be called
[#501](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS/issues/501)
[#502](https://github.com/macs3-project/MACS/issues/502)

2) Note: different numpy, scipy, sklearn may give slightly
	different results for hmmratac results. The current standard
	results for automated testing in `/test` directory are from Numpy
	1.25.1, Scipy 1.11.1, and sklearn 1.3.0.

## Install

The common way to install MACS is through
[PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/macs3/)) or
[conda](https://anaconda.org/macs3/macs3). Please check the
[INSTALL](./docs/INSTALL.md) document for detail.

MACS3 has been tested using GitHub Actions for every push and PR in
the following architectures:

 * x86_64 (Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
 * aarch64 (Python 3.9)
 * armv7 (Python 3.9)
 * ppc64le (Python 3.9)
 * s390x (Python 3.9)
 * Apple chips (Python 3.11)

In general, you can install through PyPI as `pip install macs3`. 
To use virtual environment is highly recommended. Or you can install
after unzipping the released package downloaded from Github, then
use `pip install .` command. Please note that, we haven't tested
installation on any Windows OS, so currently only Linux and Mac OS
systems are supported.

## Usage

Example for regular peak calling on TF ChIP-seq:

`macs3 callpeak -t ChIP.bam -c Control.bam -f BAM -g hs -n test -B -q 0.01`

Example for broad peak calling on Histone Mark ChIP-seq:

`macs3 callpeak -t ChIP.bam -c Control.bam --broad -g hs --broad-cutoff 0.1`

Example for peak calling on ATAC-seq (paired-end mode):

`macs3 callpeak -f BAMPE -t ATAC.bam -g hs -n test -B -q 0.01`
