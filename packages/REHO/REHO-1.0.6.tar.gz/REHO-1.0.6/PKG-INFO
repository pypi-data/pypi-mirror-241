# REHO
Renewable Energy Hub Optimizer (REHO) is a decision support tool for sustainable urban energy system planning.

It is developed by EPFL (Switzerland), within the Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineering (IPESE) group.

REHO simultaneously addresses the optimal design and operation of capacities, catering to multi-objective considerations
across economic, environmental, and efficiency criteria. Its MILP framework, multi-objective optimization, multi-scale adaptability,
consideration of diverse end-use demands, and multi-energy integration drive informed decision-making for renewable energy deployment in urban areas.

**Version 1.0 of the model.**

## Installation
To run REHO, both AMPL and Python 3 needs to be installed. Further details can be found in the documentation.
