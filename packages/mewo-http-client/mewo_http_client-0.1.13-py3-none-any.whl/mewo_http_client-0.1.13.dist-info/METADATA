# mewo-http-client

This repo contains:

- A http client lirary.
- A cli tool to help with http calls.

The library is very high-level and opinionated. It's a wrapper around the 'requests' library.
The main goal is to make http serivce to service communication super simple in regards to retry-logic and loggin.
The library is created with mewo services in mind (e.g. mub).
This is not intended to be a flexible http client for all purposes. It just offers a simple, opinionated, highlevel interface for http communication within mewo.
