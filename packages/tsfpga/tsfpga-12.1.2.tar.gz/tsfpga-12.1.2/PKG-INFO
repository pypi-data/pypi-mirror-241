tsfpga is a flexible and scalable development platform for modern FPGA projects.
With its Python-based build/simulation flow it is perfect for CI/CD and test-driven development.
The API is simple and easy to use
(a complete `simulation project <https://tsfpga.com/simulation.html>`__ is set up in less than
15 lines).

**See documentation on the website**: https://tsfpga.com

**Check out the source code on gitlab**: https://gitlab.com/tsfpga/tsfpga

Key features
------------

* Source code centric `project structure <https://tsfpga.com/module_structure.html>`__
  for scalability.
  Build projects, test configurations, constraints, IP cores, etc. are handled close to the
  source code, not in a central monolithic script.
* Automatically adds build/simulation sources if a recognized folder structure is used.
* Enables `local VUnit test configuration
  <https://tsfpga.com/simulation.html#local-configuration-of-test-cases>`__ without
  multiple ``run.py``.
* Handling of `IP cores <https://tsfpga.com/simulation.html#simulating-with-vivado-ip-cores>`__
  and `simlib <https://tsfpga.com/simulation.html#vivado-simulation-libraries>`__
  for your simulation project, with automatic re-compile when needed.
* Python-based `Vivado build system <https://tsfpga.com/fpga_build.html>`__ where many builds can
  be run in parallel.
* Tightly integrated with `hdl_registers <https://hdl-registers.com>`__.
  Register code generation is performed before each simulation and each build.
* Released under the very permissive BSD 3-Clause License.

The maintainers place high focus on quality, with everything having good unit test coverage and a
thought-out structure.
The project is mature and used in many production environments.
